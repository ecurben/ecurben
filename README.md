- 👋 Hi, I’m Bruce Nevin a.k.a. @ecurben
- 👀 My work is in [linguistics]([zelligharris.org) ([Pit River](https://zelligharris.org/Achumawi/achumawi-db.html), Yana, & now Wintu, in northeastern California), and in [Perceptual Control Theory](https://www.iapct.org/) (PCT).
- 🌱 I’m currently concluding a 3-year NSF grant and about to start another, at the end of which I plan to publish a grammar, dictionary, and texts and donate the Achumawi database to the indigenous language activists that I work with. 
- 💞️ The work includes initiating a like database for Atsugewi, Wintu, and other languages in the area if language activists for them step up to it.
- 📫 Contact: bruce.nevin@gmail.com or for PCT bnhpct@gmail.com.
